That's a fantastic idea for a portfolio\! Here is a draft for your **README.md** file, emphasizing your commitment to solving the problems without the aid of a Large Language Model (LLM).

# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python (ISL-Python) Labs and Exercises Portfolio

This repository documents my completed **Labs** and **Exercises** from the textbook ***Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*** by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.

-----

## Project Overview

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive record of my practical application and understanding of the statistical learning concepts covered in the ISL-Python text. Each chapter's folder contains jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) where I implement the statistical methods using Python libraries such as **`numpy`**, **`pandas`**, **`scikit-learn`**, **`statsmodels`**, and **`matplotlib`/`seaborn`**.

The main goals of this project are:

  * To **solidify theoretical knowledge** through hands-on implementation.
  * To build a **practical portfolio** demonstrating proficiency in core statistical learning techniques.
  * To develop **clean, reproducible, and well-documented Python code** for statistical analysis.

## Commitment to Independent Work (No LLMs Used)

**A core principle of this portfolio is the commitment to independent problem-solving and coding.**

I affirm that **no Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or similar generative AI tools, were used to *write, generate, debug, or solve* the code or the exercises presented in this repository.

### Why This Commitment?

1.  **Genuine Skill Development:** The value of this portfolio lies in demonstrating my **authentic ability** to translate mathematical concepts into functional code and debug complex implementations on my own. Using an LLM would undermine this process and obscure my actual skill level.
2.  **Deep Understanding:** Writing the code from scratchâ€”including the inevitable mistakes and debuggingâ€”forces a **deeper conceptual understanding** of both the statistical models and the programming tools.
3.  **Portfolio Integrity:** This repository is intended as an honest representation of my capabilities for potential employers or academic reviewers. **Authenticity is paramount.**

The solutions reflect my own research, reading of documentation (e.g., `scikit-learn` official guides), study of the textbook, and independent programming effort.
